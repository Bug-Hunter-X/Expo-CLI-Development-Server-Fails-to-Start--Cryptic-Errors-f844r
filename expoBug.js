While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server wouldn't start, displaying a cryptic error message related to a missing dependency or a corrupted cache.  The exact error varied, sometimes mentioning webpack, Metro bundler, or other internal components. Standard troubleshooting steps like `expo start --clear` or reinstalling dependencies didn't resolve the problem.  My `package.json` and `package-lock.json` seemed correct, and other Expo projects on the same machine worked without issues.
